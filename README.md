## **The following project concerns the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set

## **Iris data set

In 1936 Edgar Anderson collected, 50 samples of three different types of iris, or 150 samples in total. For each sample, he measures the sepal length and width, and he measured the petal length and width, and recorded those measurements along with its species. 

The following Python script that reads the Iris data set in and prints the four numerical values on each row in a nice format. That is, on the screen should be printed the petal length, petal width, sepal length and sepal width, and these values should have the decimal places aligned, with a space between the columns. this script also includes the type of species of Iris.

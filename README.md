The following project concerns the well-known Fisherâ€™s Iris data set

In 1936 Edgar Anderson collected, 50 samples of three different types of iris, or 150 samples in total. For each sample, he measures the sepal length and width, and he measured the petal length and width, and recorded those measurements along with its species.
